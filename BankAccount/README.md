# Banking Application Project

## Overview
Creating a basic banking application is a great way to practice your Java skills. This project introduces many basic Java concepts like printing, variables, if/else statements, strings, loops, and more. Youâ€™ll create an application that allows a user to check a bank balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the interface.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Open your preferred Java IDE and create a new project.

2. **Define the Main Structure:**
   - Plan out the classes and methods you'll need. A basic structure could include a `Main` class, a `BankAccount` class, and potentially a `Bank` class to manage multiple accounts.

### Step 2: Create the BankAccount Class
1. **Define Fields:**
   - Define fields for the account balance, account holder's name, and account number.

2. **Create Constructor:**
   - Write a constructor to initialize these fields.

3. **Implement Methods:**
   - Create methods to:
     - Check the balance.
     - Deposit money.
     - Withdraw money.
     - Display account information.

### Step 3: Create the Main Class
1. **Set Up the Main Method:**
   - In the `Main` class, set up the `main` method.

2. **Instantiate BankAccount Objects:**
   - Create one or more `BankAccount` objects for testing.

3. **Create a User Interface:**
   - Use a simple text-based interface (e.g., using `Scanner` for input) to interact with the user.
   - Display a menu with options to check the balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit.

### Step 4: Implement User Interface Logic
1. **Display Menu:**
   - Print the menu options to the console.

2. **Handle User Input:**
   - Use a loop to keep the application running until the user chooses to exit.
   - Read user input and call the appropriate methods on the `BankAccount` object based on the user's choice.

3. **Perform Actions:**
   - Implement logic to handle each menu option (e.g., checking balance, depositing, withdrawing).

### Step 5: Testing and Debugging
1. **Test Each Function:**
   - Thoroughly test each feature (checking balance, deposit, withdraw) to ensure they work correctly.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., withdrawing more money than available, depositing negative amounts).

2. **Debug Issues:**
   - Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.

### Step 6: Enhance the Application
1. **Add More Features:**
   - Consider adding more features such as transfer between accounts, account creation, and deletion.

2. **Improve User Interface:**
   - Enhance the user interface for better user experience.

### Step 7: Finalize and Document
1. **Finalize Code:**
   - Clean up the code, remove any unnecessary comments, and ensure it's well-organized.

2. **Document the Application:**
   - Write documentation to explain how the application works and how to use it.
