# java_number_guessing_game
This is a simple game that can help you get your feet wet with Java. The game is relatively simple â€” the computer generates a random number, and the user must guess the number. The computer will then let the user know that their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This can be free-form, allowing an unlimited number of guesses, or give the user a set number of guesses before the game ends.

Number guessing games involve some Java programming basics like accepting inputs from the user, creating classes, and using conditional statements. GeeksforGeeks offers a number guessing game walkthrough that can help you get started.
