Programming a calculator is a great beginning project for people learning many different programming languages, including Java. It’s a great introduction due to its simplicity and covers many of the most basic programming concepts.

This is a great Java project for beginners because you can build your calculator’s functionality as your skills grow. Initially, your calculator might perform basic functions like addition and subtraction, building in geometric expressions and scientific calculations as your skills grow. Later on, you can also build in a more complex user interface.

UMK Games has a Java calculator app development tutorial to help you get started on your project.
